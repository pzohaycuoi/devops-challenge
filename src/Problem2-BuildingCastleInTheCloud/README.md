# Solution Overview
This solution is designed as a highly available, low-latency trading system inspired by platforms such as Binance. It operates in an **active-active** configuration across two AWS Regions, ensuring minimal downtime and rapid failover in the event of a regional disruption. By distributing the workload across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) in each region and leveraging AWS global services, the system maintains a p99 response time below 100 ms, while supporting a throughput of 500 requests per second.

## 1. Architecture at a Glance
**Architecture Diagram**
![Architecture Diagram](./imgs/architect.png)
1. **Global Services**  
   - **Amazon Route 53** for DNS-based traffic routing (latency or weighted routing).  
   - **Amazon CloudFront** as the Content Delivery Network (CDN) for static assets and edge caching.  
   - **AWS WAF** to protect against common web exploits and provide additional security controls at the edge.  
   - **AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)** for SSL/TLS certificate provisioning and management.

2. **Regional Services**  
   Each region hosts a mirrored stack to enable active-active functionality:  
   - **Amazon API Gateway** with a **Lambda Authorizer** (or Amazon Cognito) for authentication and authorization.  
   - **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** to distribute traffic across containers or serverless functions.  
   - **AWS Fargate** (under Amazon ECS) for compute.  
   - **Amazon Aurora (MySQL or PostgreSQL) with Multi-AZ** for transactional and NoSQL data, respectively.  
   - **Amazon MemoryDB (Redis)** for low-latency caching.  
   - **AWS Secrets Manager** for secure handling of credentials.  
   - **Amazon S3** for storing static content and application artifacts (with cross-region replication if needed).

3. **Observability and Management**  
   - **Amazon CloudWatch** for metrics, logs, and alarms.  
   - **AWS X-Ray** for distributed tracing and performance analysis.  
   - **AWS CloudTrail** for auditing API calls.  
   - **AWS CodePipeline**, **CodeBuild**, and **CodeDeploy** for CI/CD.

4. **Network Architecture**  
   - **VPC** with public and private subnets in multiple AZs.  
   - **NAT Gateways** to allow outbound internet access for private subnets.  
   - **Security Groups** and **Network ACLs** for controlled inbound and outbound traffic.

## 2. Data Flow

1. **Client Requests**  
    - Client makes an HTTPS request to the example.com domain. Route 53 resolves the domain.
    - Client makes the request to the closest CloudFront Points of Presence (PoP) location to the client.
    - CloudFront speeds up the distribution of your content by routing each request through the AWS global network to the edge location that can best serve your content. Typically, this is a CloudFront edge server that provides the fastest delivery to the viewer.
    - CloudFront PoP location makes a DNS request to Route 53 to resolve the origin domain name example.com. Since this domain name has the latency-based routing policy configured in Route 53, the IP addresses are returned of the API Gateway in the closest Region to the CloudFront PoP location.
    - CloudFront PoP location makes HTTP request to the API Gateway to the appropriate origin (APIGW/ALB) in the closest Region.
    - Users connect to the trading application through Route 53, which uses latency-based routing to direct them to the region with the lowest latency.

2. **Edge and Security**  
   Requests pass through CloudFront and AWS WAF for caching static content and applying security rules. SSL/TLS termination happens at CloudFront and the ALB, with certificates managed by ACM.

3. **Application Entry**  
   CloudFront forwards requests to an **API Gateway** endpoint in the chosen region. The API Gateway uses a **Lambda Authorizer** and **Amazon Cognito** to validate user tokens and permissions.

4. **Compute Layer**  
   Authenticated requests are routed to **AWS Fargate** containers (via an ALB)

5. **Database and Persistence**  
   - **Aurora (MySQL/PostgreSQL) Multi-AZ** store core trading data.  
   - **MemoryDB (Redis)** provides low-latency caching for session data, frequently accessed market data, and ephemeral states.  
   - **Amazon S3** stores static assets, logs, and other unstructured data.

6. **Response**  
   The response is returned to the user through the same path in reverse order, ensuring consistent performance and security checks.

## 3. High Availability Strategy

- **Active-Active Across Regions**: Each region runs the full stack, ready to serve traffic at all times. This eliminates single-region dependency and reduces failover times significantly.  
- **Multi-AZ Deployments**: Within each region, critical services such as Aurora and ECS tasks are spread across multiple Availability Zones.  
- **Load Balancing & Auto Scaling**: ALBs distribute incoming requests evenly, while Auto Scaling (for ECS tasks or Lambda concurrency) adjusts capacity based on real-time traffic and performance metrics.  
- **Cross-Region Replication**:  
  - **Aurora Global Database** ensure data is replicated and kept consistent across regions.  
  - **S3 Cross-Region Replication** can be configured for important data that must be available in both regions.

## 4. Performance and Low Latency Considerations

- **Latency-Based Routing**: Route 53 directs clients to the closest region in terms of network latency, reducing round-trip times.  
- **Caching Layers**:  
  - **CloudFront** caches static assets at edge locations.  
  - **MemoryDB (Redis)** handles frequently accessed data to minimize database reads.  
- **Containerized Compute**: ECS Fargate can scale quickly to handle spikes in traffic.  
- **p99 < 100 ms**: By reducing network hops, optimizing queries, and leveraging in-memory caches, the architecture is designed to closely reach the 100 ms p99 response time target.

---

## 5. Scalability Approach

- **ECS/Fargate Auto Scaling**: Horizontal scaling of containers based on CPU/memory usage, queue length (if using SQS), or custom CloudWatch metrics.  
- **Lambda Concurrency**: Lambda functions scale automatically based on concurrent requests, ensuring sudden surges are handled smoothly.  
- **Aurora Autoscaling**: Auroraâ€™s serverless or provisioned autoscaling features can be used to handle peak workloads.  
- **DynamoDB On-Demand or Provisioned Capacity**: DynamoDB automatically scales to meet traffic demands, or use provisioned capacity with auto scaling for more predictable workloads.  
- **Sharding and Partitioning**: For very large datasets, partitioning in Aurora or using advanced sharding patterns can be introduced to keep query performance high.

## 6. Security and Compliance

- **Network Segregation**: Private subnets host databases and application services, while public subnets only expose load balancers or NAT Gateways.  
- **Encryption**:  
  - **TLS** in transit using ACM-managed certificates.  
  - **KMS**-backed encryption at rest for S3, Aurora.
- **Secrets Management**: **AWS Secrets Manager** stores and rotates database credentials and other sensitive information.  
- **AWS WAF & Security Groups**: Fine-grained rules to block malicious traffic and allow only necessary ports/protocols.  
- **Monitoring and Audit**:  
  - **CloudTrail** logs API actions for auditing.  
  - **CloudWatch** and **X-Ray** provide monitoring, alerting, and distributed tracing.

---

## 7. Deployment and CI/CD

- **AWS CodePipeline** orchestrates the build-test-deploy steps.  
- **AWS CodeBuild** runs unit tests, integration tests, and security scans.  
- **AWS CodeDeploy** or Blue/Green deployments for ECS/Lambda to minimize downtime and reduce deployment risk.  
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: AWS CloudFormation or AWS CDK templates ensure consistent, repeatable deployments across regions.

---

## 8. Future Growth and Evolution

- **Additional Regions**: The active-active pattern can be extended to more AWS regions for an even more global presence and improved latency.  
- **Microservices**: As new features are added, they can be deployed as separate microservices behind the API Gateway, scaling independently.  
- **Event-Driven Patterns**: Introducing Amazon Kinesis for asynchronous event processing can improve system responsiveness and decouple services further.  
- **Analytics and Machine Learning**: Historical trade data can be offloaded to Amazon S3 or Amazon Redshift for analytics. AWS Machine Learning services can be used to build advanced trading algorithms or fraud detection.
